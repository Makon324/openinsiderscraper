# openinsiderscraper

This Python script is designed to scrape insider trading data from the OpenInsider website for a list of stock tickers. It handles scraping, data aggregation and saving the results to a CSV file.

# How does it work

The script scrapes data about the given tickers and appends any new rows (not yet scraped) to the CSV file.

# Const parameters

There are 3 const parameters that you should change freely.
- ```link``` this is the link to CSV file
- ```default_ticker_link``` this is the link to file with default tickers to scrape if no other arguments are present
- ```num_processes``` this is the default number of processes the scraper will run on

# Using tickers in a file

The file needs to be a txt one with tickers placed line by line.

# How to run it

To run the script, run: ```python <path_to_script>```
- If you don't specify any parameters, it will scrape tickers from the default file.
- You can also pass tickers as command-line arguments.
- Alternatively, use the -f option to specify a file of tickers to scrape: ```python <path_to_script> -f <path_to_file>```
